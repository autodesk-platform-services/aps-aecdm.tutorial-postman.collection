## What's Postman?
Postman is a popular tool that provides an easy-to-use interface to send HTTP requests. Postman is able to parse the responses that APS sends you and save response parameter values to variables. These parameters can then be reused in subsequent requests through these variables. The Postman collections in this repository use this ability to provide pre-populated HTTP requests to help you follow the tutorial workflow with minimal effort. You can also modify the requests and experiment without having to write a single line of code.
